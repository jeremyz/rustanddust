fix resize issues

Board
    - build possible moves List<GridPoint3>
    - build possible attacks List<GridPoint3>
    - build possible assits List<PawnGridPoint3 ??>
    - add debug mode: click out of mpa -> circle through show ROADS TOWN HILLS
    - support Orientation offset
    - support inverted even/odd row scheme

Tile
    - automatic overlays to show unit stack depth

Pawn
    - public abstract boolean isUnit(); => unit stack depth

might think about decorator pattern for overlays
